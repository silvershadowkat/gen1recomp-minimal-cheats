-- Gen 3 Box
--
-- A Ruby/Sapphire-style storage screen over Gen 1's twelve boxes of twenty:
-- a grid you can see, a cursor that picks a Pokemon up and puts it down,
-- and one button between the box and your party.
--
-- ------- why the grid is drawn from battle pics
--
-- Gen 3's grid works because every species has its own icon. Gen 1 has no
-- such thing: the icon table maps a species to one of a handful of shapes
-- -- GRASS, MON, WATER, BUG -- and the whole game carries four icon
-- images. Twenty identical blobs in a grid is strictly worse than the
-- vanilla list of twenty names, so the grid is drawn from the `spriteFront`
-- field instead: 154 per-species pictures already decoded out of the ROM.
--
-- They are 40x40 or 56x56, and the cell is 28x28, so they draw at exactly
-- half scale. Half is deliberate -- an integer divisor keeps two-bit pixel
-- art crisp, where 0.6 would smear it -- and it makes the arithmetic land:
-- five columns of 28 is 140 across a 160-wide screen, four rows is 112 of
-- the 144 down, leaving a header and a footer.
--
-- ------- what a slot means
--
-- Gen 1 stores a box as a COMPACT array (src/pokemon/Boxes.lua), not Gen
-- 3's sparse grid: box[1..n] with nothing after n. This screen keeps it
-- that way, because the vanilla PC, the save format and every other mod
-- read that shape. So dropping into any empty cell appends to the end
-- rather than leaving a hole -- the one place this is not a faithful copy
-- of Ruby, and the price of a save the rest of the game still understands.

local COLS, ROWS = 5, 4
local PARTY_COLS, PARTY_ROWS = 3, 2

-- ------- the two layouts
--
-- CLASSIC is the 160x144 Game Boy screen: a 28-pixel cell with the pic at
-- half scale, which is what every version up to 1.4.0 drew.
--
-- BIG asks the renderer for a 320x288 surface. The engine offers this
-- properly: `Game:draw` calls `Renderer:setUISize(top:uiSize())` before
-- anything draws, and falls back to 160x144 the moment this screen is not
-- on top -- so there is nothing to restore and no way to leave the game
-- wearing a canvas it did not ask for.
--
-- 56 is the number that makes BIG worth having, twice over:
--
--   * a battle pic is 56x56, so it is drawn at scale 1. Not enlarged, not
--     shrunk -- every pixel of the sprite is one pixel of the canvas, the
--     first time this screen has shown one undamaged.
--   * 56 is SEVEN TILES exactly, and a palette zone is addressed in
--     tiles. A 28-pixel cell is three and a half, which cannot carry a
--     zone at all. That is the whole reason the colours below are only
--     possible in this mode.

  -- gridX 16 rather than 20: 5x56 = 280 leaves a 40-pixel margin, and
  -- half of it is not a whole tile. Eight pixels off centre is invisible;
